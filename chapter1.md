# Chapter 1 what is the Shell


## Key Concepts

1. Shell

shell is a program with keyboard commands as **input** and passes them to OS to carry out.

2. Terminal Emulator

when working with GUI, we use another program called **Terminal Emulator** to interact with the shell.

Terminal on Mac is one of the terminal emulators.

3. Shell prompt
which appears whenever the shell is ready to accept input. 

if the last character of the prompt is a `#` instead of `$`, the terminal session has superuser privileges

4. Command history

Most linux distributions remembers the last `500` commands by default.

5. Virtual Terminals

the terminal sessions running behind the graphic desktop. they usually can be accessed in most linux distributions.

Mac OS is not a BSD distribution and does not support that.
